ComBus
======

A collection of communication protocols I2C, UART, SPI,...etc

I found that people are always creating their own layer on top of the posix layer provided by the linux kernel to use the I2C or SPI or UART,
I thought it might a good idea to have a well designed and tested implementation as a c++ collection of classes to handle these protocols.
